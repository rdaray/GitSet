### Creating New Repository ###

You can create a new repository on your personal account or any organization where you have sufficient permissions. In the upper left corner, you should see your personal account name and thumbnail. If your organization is showing instead, and you are not a manager in the organization, you will not be able to create Repository. Click your Member name to switch to your personal account "context".

As a security measure, it is a good practice to ensure Pull Requests (PRs) must be made on a separate branch and require at least one review from a team member to be merged in the master branch.

### Adding Branch Protection Rules ###

1. Click **Settings** in the repository
2. Click **Branches** in the left column
3. By **Branch protection rules** click the **Add rule**
4. Under **Branch protection rule** tick the box for **Require pull request reviews before merging**. This will set the repository so PRs must be made on a separate branch and can only be merged with at least one review from a team member:

### Forking A Repository ###

For overview of Forking Repo ([https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo])

Forking a Repository (Repo) creates a copy of the Repo, so you can experiment with it and not effect the original.

Go to a Repo, and find the **Fork** button in the upper right corner. A copy of the repo will then be available to work with in your account. 

### Create an Issue ###

Report a problem in the upstream repo by creating a new issue.

In a Repo, click the **Issues** tab, and click on **New issue** at the bottom right.

Type a title in the subject box, then write up the issue under **Write**

Click on the **Submit new issue** button. The issue is created and added to the issues list.

An email notification is sent to the repo owner for the new issue.

Upstream can fix the issue. Good practice is to refer to the commit or pull request that resolved the issue before closing it.
